# fe-awakening-dialogue-dump
A dialogue dump of Fire Emblem Awakening's main story from Premonition to Chapter 11, made as a fun project for practice.

Made with vanilla HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

Features include custom backgrounds for certain chapters, cutomizable name and gender for the Avatar that changes the dialogue accordingly, and special comments if you input specific names.
